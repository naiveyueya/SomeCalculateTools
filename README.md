# SomeCalculateTools
After my financial engineering test, I hated to calculate by calculator. I wanted to use python to simplifying the calculatioin. So I just do this

## optioncalculator
I just add 2 func in it. Both of them are calculate the price tree of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\S_0)and the premium of option. And now it's just for call option.

* I will update it just for fun.
